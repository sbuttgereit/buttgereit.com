							<p>Oracle was once Steven's prime competency with a similar skill profile as listed for PostgreSQL.  However, Steven has not worked regularly with Oracle for some time; skills which were once "Proficient" are now better described as "Competent" or "Basic".</p>
							<p>Steven's Oracle hands on work was also more focused on day-to-day operational concerns than project oriented development.</p>

						<div class="flex flex-col gap-y-4">
							<p>Steven has occasionally worked with MS-SQL and MySQL, including performing installation and configuration.  This work was typically not sustained effort and was rather performed in the context of specific, limited duration projects.  Steven has managed teams developing and operating MS-SQL based applications, but this was management work with very little hands-on, individual contributor responsibility.</p>

							<h3 class="font-bold text-lg mb-1">Qt, C++, & JavaScript<span class="font-normal text-sm ml-2">(~15 years experience)</span></h3>
							<p>Steven has performed extensive work utilizing Qt, C++, and JavaScript to enhance and extend the <a href="https://xtuple.com" target="_blank" class="underline hover:bg-zinc-300">xTuple ERP</a> system client software.</p>
							<p>The xTuple ERP client is a QtWidgets (Qt 5) based desktop client written in C++ which connects directly to a PostgreSQL database server.  The client allows extensive, though fairly low level customization via QtScript sufficient to modify existing functionality and to create new forms and functionality.</p>
							<p>Steven's experience with Qt began with developing extensions using QtScript and QtDesigner (~15 years).  Later, as Steven's work focused on enhancing xTuple's core product, he worked directly on the C++ code base (~5 years).</p>
							<p>xTuple ERP targeted C++11 as the language standard for their implementation. Given the scope of C++, this skill can be difficult to characterize with a simple proficiency grade and as such C++ is listed as "Competent".  Steven's skill with business logic and OOP essentials would likely be characterized as "proficient", but some systems oriented C++ and more advanced topics such as advanced memory management, templates, etc. would be either "Competent" or "Basic" depending on their frequency in simple accounting software.</p>

							<h3 class="font-bold text-lg mb-1">Elixir/Phoenix Framework/OTP<span class="font-normal text-sm ml-2">(~2 years experience)</span></h3>
							<p>Steven selected the Elixir language for the Muse Systems Business Management System project due to its being built upon the efficient and resilient Erlang BEAM VM runtime environment, the development productivity of the language, and the availability and quality of essential frameworks and libraries including the Phoenix Framework and Ecto.</p>
							<p>Overall, Steven is "Competent" with Elixir, Phoenix, Ecto, and the other commonly used libraries.  While Steve has accomplished much with Elixir, covering a broad number of OTP and framework/library concerns, his experience with Elixir is as a solo developer and he has not yet worked with Elixir in production environments.</p>

Important context for evaluating the code in this project is that the project's nature also results in certain unconventional choices in Elixir application development as well.  Finally, the project is a work in progress and is under active development so functionality may not be complete or may change from time-to-time.</p>

							<p>Steven's has a basic HTML/CSS competence in web development matters, but typically doesn't work in web related front end development.  His skills would be consistent with a "Basic" level of proficiency.  Much of Steven's experience in this regard is from helping clients with emergency support related needs, troubleshooting issues with development work done by others.</p>
