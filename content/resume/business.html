						<div class="flex flex-col gap-y-2">
							<p>Through his professional services and management related work, Steven has gained extensive experience leading non-technical, cross-functional teams through the process of documenting operational business processes and in the development of new business processes; this being typically in response to new or changed technological capabilities.</p>
							<p>Importantly, Steven understands that often times what is left unsaid during business process reviews can be as important, or even more important, than what is said.  Steven's experience with common business practices across many functional areas allows him to query where information may be missing or assumed, where different teams have contradictory perceptions of a process, or where organizational issues may be hindering optimal outcomes.</p>
							<p>Finally, Steven is sensitive to the burdens and costs that such reviews can place on an organization and so works to manage the scope of reviews to those necessary to achieve positive outcomes overall.</p>

						<h3 class="font-bold text-lg mb-1">Gap/Fit & Functional Requirement Development</h3>
						<div class="flex flex-col gap-y-2">
							<p>Mismatches between existing or envisioned business processes and application capabilities is a common theme in business system adoption.  Steven's experience in business process review naturally extends to identifying application feature/function opportunities and deficiencies and working through bridging the gaps.</p>
							<p>First efforts are at re-working business processes to fit the available tools.  Often this is achievable without the additional risk of technical work.  Should a process oriented solution not be viable, scoping and designing a technology based solutions ensues.</p>
							<p>Capturing application functional requirements and working those into a design requires not only considering common practices and scenarios, but unavoidable edge cases as well.  Once requirements are gathered and technical work is underway, it is critical that stakeholder feedback is obtained throughout the process to ensure that early plans remain viable and the best answer is still being developed.</p>

								</ul>
								<p class="italic">Note that the design evolved between the original design of the "Sales Order Kit Configuration" form in the functional requirements document and the realized form "Kit Configuration" shown in the training documentation. This improvement was the result of user involvement during the development process.</p>

						<h3 class="font-bold text-lg mb-1">Project Team Training</h3>
						<div class="flex flex-col gap-y-2">
							<p>During implementation projects or the introduction of new systems and capabilities, ensuring that the implementing project team has familiarity in system being implemented is critical. Steven has substantial experience training project team subject matter experts in preparation for their roles in the project team.  These training sessions range from simple, single sessions covering a newly developed feature or process to week-long cross-functional ERP training courses targeting new system implementation project teams.</p>
							<p>Steven also has experience training technical teams adopting new technologies, including context setting relative to the broader business scenarios.</p>

						<h3 class="font-bold text-lg mb-1">Deployment & Advanced User Support</h3>
						<div class="flex flex-col gap-y-2">
							<p>When a new system is brought live or particularly difficult issues arise when using a system, it's often times desirable to have a professional services level of support.  Steven has provided on-site implementation "go-live support" as well as conducting complex data/audit related analysis and systems performance analysis.</p>
